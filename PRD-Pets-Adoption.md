### Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Feature: Pets Adoption

## Overview:

The goal of this feature is to provide a platform for animal shelters and rescue groups to post adoptable pets, and for potential adopters to browse and connect with these organizations to adopt a new pet.

## User Experience:

- As a potential adopter, I want to be able to search for adoptable pets by species, breed, age, size, location, and other relevant characteristics so that I can find the right match for my home and lifestyle.
- As a potential adopter, I want to be able to view detailed profiles for each adoptable pet, including photos, descriptions, personality traits, and any medical or behavioral considerations, so that I can make an informed decision about whether a particular pet is a good fit for me.
- As a potential adopter, I want to be able to contact the animal shelter or rescue group directly through the platform to ask questions, express interest, or schedule a visit to meet the pet in person.
- As an animal shelter or rescue group, I want to be able to create profiles for each of our adoptable pets, including photos, descriptions, personality traits, and any medical or behavioral considerations, so that potential adopters can learn about the pets and decide whether they are a good fit.
- As an animal shelter or rescue group, I want to be able to update the availability status of each of our adoptable pets (e.g. "adopted," "pending," "available") in real-time, so that potential adopters can see which pets are still available and avoid disappointment.

## Technical Requirements:

- The platform should be mobile-responsive and easy to use on all devices.
- The platform should have a robust search function that allows users to filter pets by various characteristics (e.g. species, breed, age, size, location).
- The platform should allow animal shelters and rescue groups to create and manage profiles for their adoptable pets, including adding and updating photos, descriptions, personality traits, and availability status.
- The platform should provide a way for potential adopters to contact the animal shelter or rescue group directly through the platform (e.g. by email or messaging).
- The platform should store user data (e.g. profiles, search history) securely and only share it with the appropriate parties (e.g. animal shelters, rescue groups) as necessary.

## Business Requirements:

- The feature should increase user engagement on the platform by providing a new and relevant source of content for potential adopters.
- The feature should improve the visibility of adoptable pets and make it easier for them to find new homes, which should benefit animal shelters and rescue groups by reducing their burden and costs.
- The feature should generate revenue for the platform through advertising, sponsorships, or other means.

## Implementation Plan:

- Conduct user research to gather feedback and requirements from potential adopters and animal shelters/rescue groups.
- Design the user interface and user experience for the feature.
- Develop the technical infrastructure to support the creation and management of pet profiles, the search function, and the communication tools.
- Test the feature thoroughly to ensure it is reliable, user-friendly, and bug-free.
- Launch the feature and monitor its performance to identify any issues or opportunities for improvement.

## Success Metrics:

- Number of pet profiles created and viewed on the platform
- Number of successful adoptions facilitated through the platform
- User satisfaction with the feature (measured through surveys or ratings)
- Revenue generated by the feature
- Cost savings for animal shelters and rescue groups (if applicable)

## Risks and Mitigations:

- One risk is that animal shelters and rescue groups may not have the resources or expertise to create and maintain accurate and compelling pet profiles, which could reduce the quality and effectiveness of the feature. To mitigate this risk, we could offer training and support to these organizations, or partner with third-party organizations that already have this expertise.

- Another risk is that potential adopters may not find the feature useful or user-friendly, which could discourage them from using it. To mitigate this risk, we could conduct extensive user testing and gather feedback from a diverse group of potential adopters to ensure that the feature meets their needs and expectations.

- A third risk is that the feature may not generate enough revenue to justify the investment in its development and maintenance. To mitigate this risk, we could explore various revenue-generating opportunities (e.g. advertising, sponsorships) and track the performance of the feature closely to ensure it is financially viable.

## Conclusion:

The Pets Adoption feature has the potential to provide a valuable service to both potential adopters and animal shelters/rescue groups, while also generating revenue for the platform. By conducting thorough user research and testing, and by addressing the identified risks, we can increase the chances of success for this feature.
